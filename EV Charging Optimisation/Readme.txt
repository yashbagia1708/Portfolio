EV Charging Optimisation and Data Analysis

Purpose:
This project aims to develop an optimisation model for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, using real-world data to analyse usage patterns and predict demand. The main objectives are:
1. To optimise the scheduling and energy allocation at charging stations.
2. To predict future demand for charging stations based on historical usage data.
3. To analyse patterns of energy consumption and EV charging behaviors.
