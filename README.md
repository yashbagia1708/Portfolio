# My projects in DSA, ML, and Software Development

This repository contains four distinct projects that showcase my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Machine Learning (ML), and Software Development. Each project is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in these areas, providing practical solutions and implementations for real-world problems.

Each project has its own **readme.txt** file that explains the details, key components, insights, significance, and the skills demonstrated in that specific project. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including optimisation, predictive analysis, classification, and deep learning.

## Projects

### 1. [EV Charging Optimisation and Data Analysis](./EV_Charging_Optimisation_and_Data_Analysis/readme.txt)
This project focuses on optimising the scheduling and energy allocation at electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, predicting future demand, and analysing energy consumption patterns. The project uses real-world data to develop forecasting and optimisation models.

Key Highlights:
- Time series forecasting with ARIMA or LSTM models for demand prediction.
- Scheduling optimisation using linear programming.
- In-depth data analysis with Pandas and visualisation with Matplotlib.

### 2. [Predictive Analysis of Blood Pressure with Polynomial, Multiple Linear, and Ridge Regression](./Predictive_Analysis_of_Blood_Pressure/readme.txt)
This project investigates the relationships between patient factors (e.g., cholesterol, weight, smoking status) and systolic blood pressure. It uses polynomial, multiple linear, and ridge regression to build predictive models.

Key Highlights:
- Polynomial regression to analyse systolic BP predictions based on cholesterol levels.
- Ridge regression to reduce overfitting and improve model robustness.
- Model evaluation with RMSE and cross-validation.

### 3. [Multi-Domain Classification with MNIST Data and Language Prediction](./Multi_Domain_Classification/readme.txt)
This project implements classification models for two different domains: binary classification of MNIST digits and multiclass classification for language prediction. It uses techniques like PCA, logistic regression, and TF-IDF for dimensionality reduction and text vectorisation.

Key Highlights:
- Logistic regression for binary and multiclass classification.
- PCA for dimensionality reduction to improve MNIST classification.
- TF-IDF for text feature extraction in language prediction tasks.

### 4. [CNN Autoencoder Project (Supervised and Unsupervised)](./CNN_Autoencoder_Project/readme.txt)
This project implements both supervised and unsupervised convolutional autoencoders using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It focuses on dimensionality reduction, image reconstruction, and classification tasks using convolutional neural networks.

Key Highlights:
- Supervised and unsupervised autoencoders for image reconstruction.
- Visualising learned embeddings of images from different classes.
- Deep learning techniques using PyTorch for training models.
